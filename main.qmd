## LLM Science Exam

This starter notebook walks through a basic example of using BERT to rank the
 answers to each question. We'll finetune BERT on the 200 public questions, then
 use the ~AutoModelForMultipleChoice~ class to generate probabilities that each 
 option correctly answers the prompt, and finally we'll turn those predictions 
 into a MAP@3-formatted prediction like `A B C`.

```{python}
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session
```
